Reviews stand program - 30/03/2025
I have created a reviews stand program. It is a webpage, which should be displayed on any iPad/tablet inside a Fullscreen browser/kiosk app.


You control it from the web dashboard, which is password protected.


It has an interactive graph showing results.


It has the ability to display a multiple choice question/s after clicking the rating. It has a 10 second timer before returning automatically to the original rate page.

For example:


This is customizable through the same web dashboard as before.



In this blog, I was using it on an iPad Air 4 with the Persistent Page app. To ensure you can't escape the app, I set up the guided access feature on the iPad.


See the code at https://github.com/MANMAKRO/reviews_stand

If you are going to deploy it, run it on a web server with PHP. Ensure that the php user has read write and execute permissions.
